# Crescendo
A music composition app that allows the user to input a melody/soprano line, and provides the user with bass, alto, and tenor parts, created using Android Studio. I used my passion of piano and music theory to create complex harmonies and implement real-time playback

How it works:
Choose any major or minor key for your composition, and input a melody/soprano line using the UI piano keyboard ðŸŽ¹


Click "PLAY" and hear a complexified harmony of your original input played back, created using chord progressions and advanced music theory concepts.


Enjoy creating! :notes: :notes:
